# Developing a Q-Learning Agent for Solving Grid World Environment Problems using Reinforcement Learning and Python

## Abstract

Grid world environment provides a foundational approach to the application of reinforcement learning. This report illustrates the process of exploration and exploitation in solving grid world problems and further details the formulation of policy, environment, observation, and action in the context of grid world problem-solving. A learning agent is created to explore using the epsilon-greedy method for the grid world environment which is configured with a board layout of 5 by 5 and the borders are bounded by four possible actions, North, South, East, and West. The agent is faced with obstacles and rewarded at the JUMP and WIN state with +5 and +10 respectively, while other states give a -1. The agent is trained for 100 episodes to stop whenever
the agent earns an average cumulative reward that is at least 10. The state values of each grid cell with the board layout are formulated and visualization is carried out at the execution of the code.
